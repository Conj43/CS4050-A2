# group19_cs4050_7050_assignment2
This assignment was our second assignment in CS 4050. Group memebers are Carson Turner, Drew Distler and Connor Joyce. We were given a program that created a dictionary GUI, that was based on birds. We were assignmened to come up with our own collection of items to replace birds and we were to implement methods to provide functionality to the buttons in GUI, as we were given the GUI but the only functional buttons were the 'play' and 'stop' sound buttons. We chose to do a collection of Lego Star Wars Characters, and created a corresponsing image, description and sound for each item in the collection. The descriptions are all in a file named 'StarWars_Lego_Database.txt'. The images and sounds for each item are in the folders 'lego_pics' and 'lego_sounds'. Each group member contributed to the project equally by brainstorming ideas, creating implementations and documenting comments. To run this Java FX program, you will use the LSW.java file which starts the GUI, you can then click 'File', then 'Fill Dictionary'. This will fill the displayed dictionary, where you can use the next, previous, first and last buttons. The final functionality of this GUI is the search feauture. You can search for records in the dictionary but typing in the full name or substring of one of the record's names, and make sure you use the corresponding size to correctly find the correct record.
